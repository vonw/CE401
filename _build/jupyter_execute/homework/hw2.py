# ### Calculate the flux emitted by the Sun in W m-2 using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law.

# In[3]:


Tsun = 5772                     # K; chosen to yield S = 1361 W m-2
E    = 5.67e-8 * Tsun**4        # W m-2
print('The flux from the Sun is:',E, 'W m-2')


# ### Calculate the total power emitted by the Sun's surface.

# In[4]:


Rs   = 695.7e6                    # meters
As   = 4*np.pi*Rs**2                 # m2
Psun = E * As
print('Power emitted by the Sun is:', Psun, 'Watts')


# ### Determine the flux (in W m-2) from the Sun, but at the distance of the Earth's orbit. NOTE that the total power from the Sun is spread over a very large area (in space...)

# In[5]:


# Average radius of Earth's orbit around the Sun.
Res   = 149.6e9                    # meters
# Surface area of a sphere with radius equal to Re.
Aes   = 4*np.pi*Res**2                # m2
# Solar Constant
S     = Psun / Aes
print('The Solar Constant for Earth is:', S, 'W m-2')


# ### Calculate the power is intercepted by the Earth as the Sun's rays pass by it.

# In[6]:


Re   = 6.4e6                        # meters
Aint = np.pi*Re**2                     # Area intercepted by Earth in m2
Pe   = S * Aint
print('The amount of power (in Watts) that is constantly intercepted by Earth is:', Pe, 'Watts')
