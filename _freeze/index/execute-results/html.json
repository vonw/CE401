Walden, Washington State University</i>\n\nThese computational notebooks were developed by Von P. Walden at Washington State University as part of the course CE401 - Climate Change Science and Engineering. Some of the notebooks are closely associated with Andrew Dessler's book, *Introduction to Modern Climate Change*, and are designed to provide engineering students with more background in how to calculate parameters that are related to Earth's climate and climate change.\n\n",
